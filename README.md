# Quiz App 🎯

A Flutter quiz application currently **under development**.

🚧 **Note:**  
The current design is still a work in progress — my main focus at this stage is implementing **Clean Architecture**, organizing project layers, and managing state using **Cubit**.

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack
- Flutter / Dart
- Clean Architecture
- Cubit (State Management)
- Local JSON Data Source
- Repository Pattern

---

## 🚧 Current Status
This project is still in progress — the UI design is simple for now because the priority is:
- Structuring the project properly (presentation, domain, data layers)
- Handling state management efficiently
- Working with local JSON questions
- Applying dependency injection and reusable components

---

## 🎯 Next Steps
- Improve UI/UX design
- Add animations and transitions
- Connect with remote APIs for dynamic questions
- Add result tracking and leaderboard features

---

## 💡 About
This project is part of my ongoing learning journey to strengthen my **Flutter architecture and state management** skills.
